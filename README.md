2) Separate combined first and last names in the author column if they are currently combined.
3) Ensure all entries in the releasedate column follow a consistent date format (DD-MM-YYYY).
4) Convert the time column from text format to a duration format that Excel recognizes.
5) Ensure the price column is in a numeric format, and identify any non-numeric values.
6) Convert text ratings in the stars column to numeric values.
7) Split the narratedby column into multiple columns if multiple narrators are listed.
8) Merge the releasedate and language columns into a single new column named releaseinfo with the format "DD-MM-YYYY, Language."
9) Ensure all currency values in the price column are formatted consistently with two decimal places.
